# Bay-Mood Milestones
<p>Milestone 1 Goals:</p>
<p>1. Finalize Project Description</p>
<p></p>
<p> The first major step in my Milestone consisted of doing more research to truly define the project instead of having
  a general broad description. I went back and forth on my project, but ended up deciding to go with my original project idea which 
  is a mental health speaker. After doing research I called upon disney inspirations such as Inside Out and Big Hero 6. Ultimately I decided
  to make a friendly mood tracker that keeps track of its user's emotions and stores it in a chart so that it can be printed out to be evaluated.   Therefore in this milestone I also finalized the project, but detailing out logistics.</p>
  
  <p> Visual Inspiration Research </p>
  
  <p> I found the below helpful in my research because the emotional questions that the device will ask about are correlated to the inside out emotions: anger, joy, sadness, disgust and fear </p>

<p> </p>
<p> Tracking these standard emotions will serve as a basis for doctors and users to make diagnosis </p>

<p> In addition to doing more research on the theme of my project, I did more research on what the actual device will look like and how I will make it. I decided that using the Google AI Voice Box was the most feasible choice with my time limitations and that I would 3D print parts to make a case for it.</p>

  <p> 2. Order, Create and secure all Physical Materials</p>

<p> - I ordered all of my my physical materials which include the Google AI Kit, an SD Card and speaker </p.
<p> </p>
<p> - The only thing I needed to create was my case for my Bay-Mood device. This required going to the Maker Space and printing several
materials. I was hoping to have everything printed by March 30th, but the printing is going to take a lot longer than I thought it would. However the pieces are currently printing and should be ready fairly soon! </p>

<p>3. Create UX/UI Design Flow</p>
