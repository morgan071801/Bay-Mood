# Bay-Mood -> Voice Journal Milestones

# Milestone 1 Goals
<p>1. Finalize Project Description</p>
<p></p>
<p> The first major step in my Milestone consisted of doing more research to truly define the project instead of having
  a general broad description. I went back and forth on my project, but ended up deciding to go with my original project idea which 
  is a mental health speaker. After doing research I called upon disney inspirations such as Inside Out and Big Hero 6. Ultimately I decided
  to make a friendly mood tracker that keeps track of its user's emotions and stores it in a chart so that it can be printed out to be evaluated.   Therefore in this milestone I also finalized the project, but detailing out logistics.</p>
  
  <p> Visual Inspiration Research </p>
  
  <p> I found the below helpful in my research because the emotional questions that the device will ask about are correlated to the inside out emotions: anger, joy, sadness, disgust and fear </p>

<p> </p>
<p> Tracking these standard emotions will serve as a basis for doctors and users to make diagnosis </p>

<p> In addition to doing more research on the theme of my project, I did more research on what the actual device will look like and how I will make it. I decided that using the Google AI Voice Box was the most feasible choice with my time limitations and that I would 3D print parts to make a case for it. I also think that the Google AI Voice Box will be the most user friendly for when I program it. Below is the case I plan to print.</p>

  <p> 2. Order, Create and secure all Physical Materials</p>

<p> - I ordered all of my my physical materials which include the Google AI Kit, an SD Card and speaker </p.
<p> </p>

<p> - The only thing I needed to create was my case for my Bay-Mood device. This required going to the Maker Space and printing several
materials. I was hoping to have everything printed by March 30th, but the printing is going to take a lot longer than I thought it would. However the pieces are currently printing and should be ready fairly soon! </p>

<p>3. Create UX/UI Design Flow</p>
<p> I first created a decision tree that maps out the decisions the user will have to make </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The decision tree help me set a basis for how the user will interact with the device acoustically and then for my next steps as I build the actual device I plan to create a chart that shows how the device will actually log that data. </p>

<p> 2. What did you do and how many hours did you work </p>
<p> I first put all the pieces together by connecting pieces such as the voice bonnett and raspberry pi. Additionally I made sure to check the
  connections and tighten screws </p>
  <p> Additionally, I had to insert speaker wires into the rasbperry pi </p>
  <p> After I built the internal part of the speaker I had to gather a mouse, monitor and hdmi cabels to ssh into the rasbperry pi and make sure
  everything was hooked up correctly including the wifi and sound system</p>
  
  <p> Overall between class time and outside of class time I probably spent around 11 hours working towards milestone 2 </p>

# Milestone 3 Goals

<p> 1. Progress I wanted to make and what you accomplished:</p>
<p> I wanted to implement the google assistant API which I was able to. Implementing the Google API was a big step because now </p>
<p> I can play games on my speaker and it works just like a google home however, I was not able to get past uniqifying the speaker to 
  serve as a journal. </p>
 
  
 <p> However because my idea required so many APIs I ran into a few rabbit hole errors which felt impossible to get past. </p>

 <p> Despite following the tutorials below using Dialogflow I was not able to get the front end connected to the back end. </p>

<p> I followed the below tutorial step by step and even implemented their code in a trial run, but for some reason I concluded that it must be a davidson domain error</p>

<p> Additionally, I ran into the below API errors <p>
  
<p> Therefore, I have decided to simplify my project into a voice time capsule/voice journaling device </p>
 
<p> The videos were to big to include in my GITHUB so see google drive link: </p>

<p> What was the hardest part? How did you overcome it? What did you learn? </p>

<p> I overcame my API challenges due to the Davidson Domain by reestablising my project and reconstructing. </p>

<p> 2. What did you do and how many hours did you work </p>
<p> - Constructed Dialogflow </p>
<p> -Registered my device </p>
<p> - Added in Credientials </p>
<p> - Filled out the consent for to register my device with google </p>
<p - Worked out errors and installed more pip packages </p>
<p> - Coded most of my project </p>




<p> Hours Spent: I spent at least 15 hours working towards Milestone 3 (Coding, Debugging, Installing Packages, Constructing Dialogflow ect.) </p>

# Milestone 4 Goals

<p/> For milestone 4, I started approaching my final MVP by constructing the form </p>

# Creative Statement

<p>I went into this project with the intent to create an emotional tracker, however, after playing around with the concept, I found that the emotional tracker idea was too complex for the time I had to create it, but it also did not have a great balance of uselessness and usefulness. Therefore, I renovated my idea and came up with a voice journal.</p>

<p>The voice journal is useful because it gives users the ability to save their memories, thoughts, and ideas in an electronic journal. Additionally, after creating a journal entry, the device automatically creates a year, month, and day folder, where it stores each recording depending on the date. This feature is useful because it allows users to easily navigate the entries if they decide to break the device apart and insert their SD card into a computer. The voice journal is useless because the user cannot look back to see their entries as easily compared to a regular journal. Instead, they need to break open the device to acquire the mini SD card and then find a converter to listen to the entries.</p>

<p>I built the device using a raspberry pi, speaker, microSD card, push-button, button harness, a few push-offs, a micro USB cable, and a book. I began my creative journey by building the internal system first. This required me to attach the raspberry pi and voice bonnet using the standoffs. After that, I loosened the screws of the screw terminal to insert the speaker wires. While it might be shocking, I had a difficult time trying to find a mini screwdriver to screw in the speaker wires. Finally, after attaching the speakers I completed my last internal construction by connecting the colorful push button and plugging the wires into the voice bonnet.</p>

<p>After finishing the individual internal parts of the device, I pondered the question of whether the speaker component itself served as more of a useful or useless component. In other words, when using the device users of my product can hear their journal entry only once before it is stored in the device forever. This feature is useful because it serves as a feedback mechanism to let the user know what and if they recorded an entry. However, it is useless because it leaves the user&rsquo;s journal entry imperfect and uneditable.</p>

<p>When constructing the speaker I also pondered the question of whether or not I should make the button more useful or if it had the perfect balance of usefulness and useless. In other words, while the button lights up with the color blue to show the user that the device is on, it does not provide feedback to the user when the device records their voice. However, the user receives feedback from the speaker on playback which is both a useless, but unique feature.</p>

<p>Beyond the internal construction, I also created a shell for my product. My goal was to imitate a pop-up book. I did this in the maker space using cardboard, and an old book. First I ripped pages off of the book and hot glue gunned them onto the box. While this might sound simple, it took me a few hours. Afterward, I started to dig into the book with a sharp knife and create a snug square hole for the box to sit in. This process reminded me of my Book History Arts and Culture course where we destroyed books but also talked about the importance of the book&rsquo;s form. Therefore, the display of the device in the book is useful because it helps the user understand the device&rsquo;s purpose. However, the form is useless because it does not benefit the user&rsquo;s usability in any way. Instead, it restrains the user from where they can place the journal in a room because of how much room it takes up compared to a regular journal or smart speaker. Additionally, it cannot close like a regular journal because of its pop-up features.</p>

<p>Overall, I truly enjoyed this project and playing around with the concepts of usefulness and uselessness. I thought it was really cool to see it unravel from an emotional tracker into a voice journal and I am so grateful to have taken this awesome class!!</p>
