# Bay-Mood Milestones

# Milestone 1 Goals
<p>1. Finalize Project Description</p>
<p></p>
<p> The first major step in my Milestone consisted of doing more research to truly define the project instead of having
  a general broad description. I went back and forth on my project, but ended up deciding to go with my original project idea which 
  is a mental health speaker. After doing research I called upon disney inspirations such as Inside Out and Big Hero 6. Ultimately I decided
  to make a friendly mood tracker that keeps track of its user's emotions and stores it in a chart so that it can be printed out to be evaluated.   Therefore in this milestone I also finalized the project, but detailing out logistics.</p>
  
  <p> Visual Inspiration Research </p>
  
  <p> I found the below helpful in my research because the emotional questions that the device will ask about are correlated to the inside out emotions: anger, joy, sadness, disgust and fear </p>

<p> </p>
<p> Tracking these standard emotions will serve as a basis for doctors and users to make diagnosis </p>

<p> In addition to doing more research on the theme of my project, I did more research on what the actual device will look like and how I will make it. I decided that using the Google AI Voice Box was the most feasible choice with my time limitations and that I would 3D print parts to make a case for it. I also think that the Google AI Voice Box will be the most user friendly for when I program it. Below is the case I plan to print.</p>

  <p> 2. Order, Create and secure all Physical Materials</p>

<p> - I ordered all of my my physical materials which include the Google AI Kit, an SD Card and speaker </p.
<p> </p>

<p> - The only thing I needed to create was my case for my Bay-Mood device. This required going to the Maker Space and printing several
materials. I was hoping to have everything printed by March 30th, but the printing is going to take a lot longer than I thought it would. However the pieces are currently printing and should be ready fairly soon! </p>

<p>3. Create UX/UI Design Flow</p>
<p> I first created a decision tree that maps out the decisions the user will have to make </p>
<p> </p>
<p> The decision tree help me set a basis for how the user will interact with the device acoustically and then for my next steps as I build the actual device I plan to create a chart that shows how the device will actually log that data. </p>

# Milestone 2 Goals
<p> 1. Progress I wanted to make and what you accomplished:</p>
<p> For milestone 2 I wanted to get the internal speaker built and make sure everything works and I was able to do this </p>

<p> 2. What did you do and how many hours did you work </p>
<p> I first put all the pieces together by connecting pieces such as the voice bonnett and raspberry pi. Additionally I made sure to check the
  connections and tighten screws </p>
  <p> Additionally, I had to insert speaker wires into the rasbperry pi </p>
  <p> After I built the internal part of the speaker I had to gather a mouse, monitor and hdmi cabels to ssh into the rasbperry pi and make sure
  everything was hooked up correctly including the wifi and sound system</p>
  
  <p> Overall between class time and outside of class time I probably spent around 11 hours working towards milestone 2 </p>

# Milestone 3 Goals

<p> 1. Progress I wanted to make and what you accomplished:</p>
<p> I wanted to implement the google assistant API which I was able to. Implementing the Google API was a big step because now </p>
<p> I can play games on my speaker and it works just like a google home however, I was not able to get past uniqifying the speaker to 
  serve as a journal. </p>
 
  
 <p> However because my idea required so many APIs I ran into a few rabbit hole errors which felt impossible to get past. </p>

 
 <p> Despite following the tutorials below using Dialogflow I was not able to get the front end connected to the back end. </p>

<p> I followed the below tutorial step by step and even implemented their code in a trial run, but for some reason I concluded that it must be a davidson domain error</p>

<p> Additionally, I ran into the below API errors <p>
  
<p> Therefore, I have decided to simplify my project into a voice time capsule/voice journaling device </p>
 
<p> The videos were to big to include in my GITHUB so see google drive link: </p>

<p> What was the hardest part? How did you overcome it? What did you learn? </p>

<p> I overcame my API challenges due to the Davidson Domain by reestablising my project and reconstructing. </p>

<p> 2. What did you do and how many hours did you work </p>
<p> - Constructed Dialogflow </p>
<p> -Registered my device </p>
<p> - Added in Credientials </p>
<p> - Filled out the consent for to register my device with google </p>
<p - Worked out errors and installed more pip packages </p>
<p> - Coded most of my project </p>
